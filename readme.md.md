## Get this code up and running at Heroku!

In the `starter-code` folder, you will find the base code that you should be configuring and deploying.

The `solution` folder is provided as a reference (it's the code produced in the tutorial video) so that you can compare your deployed code and README to the accepted standard.

## Requirements

- Connect GitHub Actions to your repository
  - Setup the Node.js workflow

- Connect Heroku to your git account
  - Set heroku to auto deploy your repository from master (or any named branch)

- Create documentation

- Compose a complete "README"

## Testing

- Both unit and lint tests in starter code pass in GitHub Actions

### Assignment Submission Instructions

- Submit a link to the Repository you created for this lab, which should have a completed README.md file
